# Learning Git 🚀

This repository is created **only for learning and practicing Git & GitHub**.

I use this repo to understand:

- How Git works internally
- How to track changes
- How commits, branches, and merges work
- How GitHub repositories are managed

---

## What I Practice Here

- `git init`
- `git status`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git log`
- `git diff`
- `git branch`
- `git checkout`
- `git merge`
- `git stash`
- `git reset`
- `git revert`
- Working with remote repositories (`origin`)

---

## Repository Structure

This repository may contain:

- Sample text files
- Small Python files
- Temporary files created only for Git practice

The code quality is **not the focus** here — Git is.

---

## Rules for This Repo

- This is **not a production project**
- Files may be added, modified, or deleted frequently
- Commit messages are written to practice clarity
- Mistakes are allowed (this is a learning space)

---

## Goal

By the end of this practice, I should be comfortable with:

- Using Git without fear
- Fixing mistakes in Git
- Understanding Git history
- Using GitHub confidently for real projects

---

📌 _This repository exists purely for learning purposes._
